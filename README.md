## Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: v16.x or higher
- **MongoDB**: Local instance or MongoDB Atlas
- **npm**: For package management

## Installation

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the server directory with the following:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/hireme
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   ```
   Replace `MONGODB_URI` with your MongoDB connection string if using MongoDB Atlas.
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Use `nodemon` for development:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Running the Full Application
1. Ensure MongoDB is running locally or accessible via the URI.
2. Start the backend server first (`http://localhost:5000`).
3. Then start the frontend (`http://localhost:3000`).
4. The frontend communicates with the backend via API calls (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/api/...`).
